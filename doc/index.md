## Welcome
This project is part of Telefonica IoT Platform.

The connectors found at this repository are intended to be custom components for [Talend Open Studio (TOS)](https://www.talend.com/products/talend-open-studio), an open source ETL and data integration tool.

Specifically, these are the categories under which this project adds custom components for TOS:

* NGSI:
    * Orion:
        * `tOrionConnection`: specifies an authenticated connection to a certain Orion endpoint, using a certain FIWARE service.
        * `tOrionAppend`: creates an Orion entity or appends the data to an already existent one.

## About this documentation
For each category of custom components there is an **Installation and Administration Guide** and an **User and Programmer Guide**.

Additionally, there is a collection of specific documents for each custom Talend component, describing in detail its functionality, how it is configured and containing some implementation details.
