#<a name="top"></a>Configuring Talend Open Studio
This section of the manual describes how to configure Talend Open Studio (TOS) in order to add to the Palette the custom components developed for TelefÃ³nica's IoT Platform.

It is supposed a TOS is already installed. It is not in the scope of this document to guide you through the installation process. Please, check the Talend [documentation](https://www.talend.com/download/talend-open-studio). It is important to download and install the Data Integration flavour of TOS.

##Setting TOS preferences
Open TOS and click *Window* in the toolbar, then follow this path: *Preferences > Talend > Component*. Then, simply configure the *User component folder* with a folder of your choice:

Finally, press *OK* to confirm.

##Downloading and installing the components
There are two ways of downloading our custom components: [Talend Exchange](https://exchange.talend.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotp-talend-connectors).

###From Talend Exchange
Coming soon.

###From Github
This way of downloading the components requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed in your system.

Start by cloning the [iotp-talend-connectors]((https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotp-talend-connectors)) Github repository somewhere in your file system:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotp-talend-connectors.git
Cloning into 'iotp-talend-connectors'...
remote: Counting objects: 137, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (79/79), done.
remote: Total 137 (delta 43), reused 118 (delta 40), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (137/137), 813.54 KiB | 72.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (43/43), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

Then, change directory to `iotp-talend-connectors` and change to the `develop` branch (at the moment of writting this there is no official release yet):

```
$ cd iotp-talend-connectors/
$ git checkout develop
Branch develop set up to track remote branch develop from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'develop'
```

The custom components are under `components/` subfolder:

```
$ ls components/
tOrionAppend		tOrionConnection
```

In order to install them, simply copy the content of `components/` to the *User component folder* you specified when setting TOS preferences.

```
$ cp -r components/* /path/to/components
```

##Checking the Palette
The new added components must appear in the *Palette* if looking by the *tOrion* key word:

##Troubleshooting
If the components don't appear in the *Palette*, try the following:

1. Delete the components cache of TOS. This is a file named `ComponentsCache.javacache` under `/pat/to/TOS/configuration` folder.
2. Open the *Component Designer* view of TOS: click *Window* in the toolbar, then follow this path: *Perspective > Component Designer*.
3. In the *Component Designer* tab in the left, move the mouse over the components, click right and click *Push Components to Palette*.
4. Return to the *Integration* view: click *Window* in the toolbar, then follow this path: *Perspective > Integration*.

5. Check the components are now in the *Palette*.
