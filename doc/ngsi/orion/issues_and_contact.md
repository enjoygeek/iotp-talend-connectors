#Reporting issues
There are several channels suited for reporting issues and asking for doubts in general. Each one depends on the nature of the question:

* If you are a Telefonica IoT Platform **customer**, use [iot_support@tid.es](mailto:iot_support@tid.es) for any question you may have.
* For the general public, use [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) for specific questions about this software. Typically, these will be related to installation problems, errors and bugs. Development questions when forking the code are welcome as well. Use the `iotp-talend-connectors` tag.
* Personal email, as listed below.

**NOTE**: Please try to avoid personaly emailing the contributors unless they ask for it. In fact, if you send a private email you will probably receive an automatic response enforcing you to use [stackoverflow.com](stackoverflow.com). This is because using the mentioned methods will create a public database of knowledge that can be useful for future users; private email is just private and cannot be shared.
